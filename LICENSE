You may view, but not keep a copy for an extended amount of time (for example,
for more than a week) of the contents in this repository, either in encrypted
form or clear-text form, without notifying the author of the file.

If you intend to keep a copy of a file for an extended amount of time, you must
seek permission from the author before doing so.

In all cases, due to the nature of the matter contained in those files, you must
respond to and promptly delete the files that you obtained/derived from this
repository upon the author's request.

All other uses are not permitted, unless the author has explicitly granted you
with written permission.
